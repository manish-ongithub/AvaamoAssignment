# AvaamoAssignment

The above assignment loads bigText file from local path, as http://norvig.com/big.txt gives CORS error.
Launch chrome with command line argument --allow-file-access-from-files and open file avaamo.html.
Instead of loading bigText.txt file, we can also paste text into the text area and click "Count Words" button to do word analysis; 

File script.js has all necessary javascript functions.

The code has been tested with Chrome (Version 75.0.3770.100) .
