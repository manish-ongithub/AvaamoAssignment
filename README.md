# AvaamoAssignment

The above assignment loads bigText file from local path, as http://norvig.com/big.txt gives CORS error.

In script.js change "var TEXT_FILE_URL" to suitable path to open local text file. 

Launch chrome with command line argument --allow-file-access-from-files and open file avaamo.html.

File script.js has all necessary javascript functions.

Instead of loading text file, we can also paste text into the text area and click "Count Words" button to do word analysis; 

The code has been tested with Chrome (Version 75.0.3770.100) .
